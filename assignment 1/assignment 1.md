# Assignment 1

## Introduction 
We have taken a tissue biopsy from an ovarian cancer patient. The biopsy includes benign and cancer cells. We measured 30 different characeritics (features) of the cells. These features represent various morphological properties as well as the expression of various proteins on the surface of the cell. 
We would like to perform exploratory anaysis of the measured features and see if we can design machine learning tools to separate the benign (B) and malignant (M) cells.
